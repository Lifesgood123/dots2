1 (16 ounce) package uncooked farfalle (bow tie) pasta
1 tablespoon hot chile paste (such as sambal oelek)
6 tablespoons prepared basil pesto
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 cup chopped cilantro
Add all ingredients to list
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Place farfalle pasta in the pot, cook for 8 to 10 minutes, until al dente, and drain.
Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Mix in the chile paste and chicken. Cook and stir chicken 10 minutes, or until evenly browned and juices run clear.
Toss the cooked farfalle, pesto, Parmesan cheese, and cilantro into the skillet, and continue cooking just until heated through.
