Combine water, salt, 2 tablespoons butter, and red chili peppers in a pot over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil.

Heat sesame oil in a skillet or wok over medium heat. Cook and stir garlic until fragrant, about 1 minute; pour in half the soy sauce.
Cook and stir chicken, basil, white pepper, dry mustard, and turmeric with garlic until chicken is browned, no longer pink in the center, and juices run clear, 5 to 8 minutes.
Mix remaining soy sauce into chicken mixture.
Cook and stir 1 tablespoon butter with broccoli, green pepper, red pepper, and onion in a separate skillet until tender, about 10 minutes.  Stir lemon juice into vegetables.
Toss vegetables with chicken.
