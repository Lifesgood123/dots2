Combine shrimp, sesame seeds, garlic, ginger, cayenne pepper, and black pepper in a large resealable plastic bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes.
Heat sesame oil in a large wok or skillet over medium-high heat. Add red bell pepper and green onions and stir-fry until slightly softened, 3 to 4 minutes. Add shrimp with marinade, sugar snap peas, and teriyaki sauce and stir-fry until shrimp are opaque, about 4 minutes.
Stir chicken broth and cornstarch together in a bowl until smooth. Pour into the skillet. Cook, stirring constantly, until mixture boils. Season with salt.
