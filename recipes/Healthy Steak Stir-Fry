Mix steak sauce, soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, and brown sugar together in a bowl until sauce is smooth.
Heat sesame oil in a wok or large skillet over high heat; saute onion and ginger over medium-high heat until onion is lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Add steak, broccoli, mushrooms, and garlic; cook, stirring occasionally, until steak is cooked through and vegetables are soft, about 8 minutes.
Pour sauce over steak mixture; cook and stir until evenly coated, about 2 minutes.
