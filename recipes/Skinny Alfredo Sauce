1 tablespoon grapeseed oil
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1 cup chicken broth
1 cup fat-free milk
2/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
Heat oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic; cook and stir until golden, about 1 minute. Mix in flour and cook until you have a thick paste, about 1 minute. Whisk chicken broth in slowly until mixture is smooth, about 2 minutes. Pour in milk and whisk until smooth.
Simmer mixture until thick, about 10 minutes. Add Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper; stir until cheese melts and sauce is smooth.
